# Examples

Sample applications for testing with imprint.

## screenshot-demo

A [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) TUI demonstrating visual elements that require screenshot analysis. Shows random colors and intentional visual bugs.

See [screenshot-demo/README.md](screenshot-demo/README.md) for details.

## text-demo

A minimal Bubble Tea TUI for testing imprint's `get_screen_text` endpoint. Demonstrates vim-style navigation (j/k) and selection.

See [text-demo/README.md](text-demo/README.md) for details.

## what-changed

A visual memory game designed to showcase imprint's screenshot capabilities. The game displays a grid of colored cells, then changes one cell - the player must identify which cell changed.

See [what-changed/README.md](what-changed/README.md) for details.
